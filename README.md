# PastCodePracticesProjects
Just a bunch of computer code I've made in the past (mostly schoolwork and stuff like that) that might be useful in the future... you never know.
I cannot assure that all of my code is complete, nor that it works (the BTree for example I know for a fact that it doesn't work at all).
I might or might not update this repository in the future with completed, working code.
